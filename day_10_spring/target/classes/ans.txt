Q.1)

Spring bean is a simple POJO class, it need not be implemented in any other spring 
framework API or extend any class.

The life cycle of bean class has five stages;
Does not Exist.
Instantiated.
initialized.
Service.
Destroy.

Q.2)
there are five types of spring bean
1) Singleton
2) prototype 
3) Request
4) Session
5) Global Session

the default scope for the spring bean is singleton there only one instance is formed for
spring container. Singleton only manages only one spring bean object and all the requests
are with an id matching that bean definition will result in that one specific bean instance
being returned by the Spring container.


Q.3)
constructor based injection requires all the fields to be done else it throws an Exception
it is not the recommended way to set the values instead of it setters are there to set the 
values and with setters we only set required values and some times constructor bases injection has
ambiguity problem but with setters, there is no problem.


Q.4)
This can be done by declaring all the bean dependencies in the Spring configuration file.
So, Spring can utilize the BeanFactory to know the dependencies across all the
used beans. The XML-configuration-based autowiring functionality has five modes
 no, byName, byType, constructor, and autodetect. 
 
 Exa-
 
 <bean name="" value="" autowire="byName" /> 
 <bean name="" value="" autowire="byType" />
