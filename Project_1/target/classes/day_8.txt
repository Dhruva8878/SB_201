 Before the Spring framework, we have to work with EJB( Enterprise Java Beans )
 which is hard to use and very complicated to understand and it does not
 provide that much security and services. Then developers were looking for an 
 an easier way to build applications. then Spring frameworks come into the market 
 which reduces all the complications. this framework uses new techniques 
 Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and dependency injection (DI), to develop 
 applications. The Spring framework is reliable to use and helps in writing 
 a clean code and provides various ways to help in managing business objects.
