The instance of EntityManager is associated with a persistence context.
The EntityManager has methods such as persist, merge, remove, find, etc.
But there is a problem with when we perform CRUD operations that we will not
get all data from the databases and cannot update all the entries in databases
and also we can get the object by the primary key, not with the composite key.
