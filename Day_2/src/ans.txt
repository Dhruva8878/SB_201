Q.1)
ans-The layered architecture is the most widely used architectural structure.
    the main idea behind the layered architecture is to organize the data in
    horizontal sequence. there are three types.
    1-Front-end- where the developer design a perfect  UI for the application.
    2-Back-end- where the developer applies the business logic of the company and manage 
               accessing data from databases.
    3-Data- where all the has been saved.
    
 Q.2)
 ans -JDBC is only used for specific database development.where JPA is used
      is over all the databases development software it gives us more flexibility
      than the JDBC.
      
 Q.3)
 ans-JPA is not an implementation.It is a java specification.
      Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.it follows the common standards
      of the JPA.
 
 Q.4)
 ans- Java Persistence API(JPA) is related to the ORM. the developer can easily
      map, store, update and retrieve the data from the databases of java. JPA is mainly
      used in java based applications.
      
 Q.5)
 ans- ORM uses mapping information to manage the process of converting data between
      its database and object forms, and generating the SQL for a relational
      database to insert, update and delete data in response to changes the 
      the application makes data objects.
      
      benefits-
      
      1-with the help of ORM, we can write SQL queries more efficiently.
      2-With ORM we can easily manage data and manipulate the data and also
        update, delete, and retrieve the data.
 
 Q.6)
 ans-
      Hibernate is an open-source Java persistence framework project.
      Perform powerful object-relational mapping and query databases using SQL.
 
      The key components of Hibernate are:
      Session: It is used to get a physical network with a database.
      Transaction: It represents the unit of work with a database.
      Query: It uses SQL to retrieve the data from the database and create objects.
